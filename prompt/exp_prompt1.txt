You are an excellent temporal causal discovery analyzer, with a good understanding of the domain knowledge in intelligent operation and maintenance of data center air-conditioning system. \nA temporal causal graph is a directed acyclic graph, represented as a list of tuples, where each tuple (u, v, t) denotes that there is an temporal causal edge from t time lag version of node u to node v. For example, (6, 5, 2) denotes that 2 time lags version of node 6 has a causal effect on node 5. \nYour task is to output the causal edges (use the tuple formation) in the causal graph.\nScence description: In modern data centers, stable IT equipment operation is crucial. Advanced air conditioning systems are used to regulate the heat generated by the equipment and maintain a stable indoor temperature. In a typical data center room, equipment rows are arranged systematically in the room, with physical barriers isolating adjacent rows of cabinets to prevent hot and cold air from mixing. Computer room air conditioners (CRACs) supply cooling on both sides of the room, creating a closed loop structure that maintains a stable environment. Multiple sensors located in the cold aisle provide real-time temperature monitoring to ensure a continuous supply of cold air. This approach enables timely adjustments to maintain stable IT equipment operation.\nThere are 38 measure points, and we consider 1 time-lag version of them, so there are 76 nodes, where node \u201cCRAC_1_lag_0, CRAC_2_lag_0, \u2026, CRAC_20_lag_0\u201d are 20 supply air temperatures of the corresponding 20 computer room air conditioners, and \u201cCRAC_1_lag_1, CRAC_2_lag_1, \u2026, CRAC_20_lag_1\u201d are 1 time-lag's version of the above nodes; \u201csensor_1, sensor_2, \u2026, sensor_18\u201d are 18 temperatures from the corresponding 18 sensors in the cold aisles, and \u201csensor_1_lag_1, sensor_2_lag_1, \u2026, sensor_18_lag_1\u201d are 1 time-lag's version of the above nodes.\nThe following coordinates are used to represent the relative position information of the 38 measure points (take the measuring point of the equipment in the bottom-left corner as the origin (0,0), and the unit is meters): CRAC1-20:(0,10.8)(2.4,10.8)(3.4,10.8)(5.4,10.8)(6.6,10.8)(9,10.8)(10.2,10.8)(12.4,10.8)(13.610.8)(17,10.8)(0,0)(1.8,0)(3.6,0)(5.4,0)(6.6,0)(8.4,0)(10.8,0)(13.2,0)(14.4,0)(17,0); sensor1-18:(17,3.9)(17,5.4)(17,7.5)(13.6,3.9)(13.6,5.4)(13.6,7.5)(10.2,3.9)(10.2,5.4)(10.2,7.5)(6.8,3.9)(6.8,5.4)(6.8,7.5)(3.4,3.9)(3.4,5.4)(3.4,7.5)(0,3.9)(0,5.4)(0,7.5)\nYou can determine which variables in the system are upstream and which are downstream, and calculate the distance between them to help you make causal inferences later.\nGive the answer as a python list at the last of your response after 'Answer:'.\nWhat are the causal edges in the causal graphs?
